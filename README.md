# A Mattermost Weather Plugin
## Summary
A small Mattermost plugin that shows current weather data using the ClimaCell API for weather data and the OpenCageData API for geocoding.

Insert your ClimaCell and OpenCageData API keys into the System Console. Both companies provide free keys which should be sufficient for small installations.

Here is a brief demonstration of the plugin:

## Installation

Download the `.tar.gz` from the [releases page](https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/mattermost-plugin-weather/releases "the releases page is the standard Github location for downloads") and install the plugin through the System Console in Mattermost. The details of that process are beyond the scope of this document.
