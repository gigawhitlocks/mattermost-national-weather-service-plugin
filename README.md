# A Mattermost Weather Plugin
## Summary
A small Mattermost plugin that shows current weather data using the ClimaCell API for weather data and the OpenCageData API for geocoding.

Set `WEATHER_KEY` and `GEOCODING_KEY` to your ClimaCell and OpenCageData API keys in the environment where Mattermost runs in order to use this plugin.

Here is a brief demonstration of the plugin:
