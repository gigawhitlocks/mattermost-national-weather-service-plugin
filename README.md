A very simple Mattermost plugin that will query the National Weather Service for the current conditions and enter them into chat. Currently US-only, sorry.

Also the NWS API is a little slow sometimes, but it's public and doesn't require an API key or anything like that.

Here is a brief demonstration of the plugin:
